## Introduction
On-campus events make up campus culture and can heavily impact a student's college experience. Unfortunately, when looking for an event, students have to search through a multitude of social media sites that are often full of unrelated information. Our app EventLife aims to be a simple app that focuses on events and factors that may affect one's decision to go to an event by listing events made by friends, giving the option to explore all events at UCSD, and maintaining private profiles for all, which ensures the app's primary focus is event planning rather than social media.

## How to Run
After installing, all that needs to be done is open the app "EventLife" and create an account using your UCSD email.

## Known Bugs
Whenever there is a change to the database, the app changes its activity to the dashboard and refreshes. This means that all users will experience this issue if multiple people are using the app. 

## Troubleshooting
To deal with the bug above, users can test multiple accounts by using the same device or using accounts as different times.\
If the app crashes, please leave the app and reload it.
